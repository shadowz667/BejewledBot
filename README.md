# BejewledBot
An exercise in machine learning. I hope to create something that learns how to play match 3 games

Current version can play Bejewled and feed data into the models

TODO:
Update the score reader to be more accurate to reduce the number of instances with bad scoring
Update the neural net to converge to a solution sooner (need help with this one)
Create documentation on setting up the board position
Devise a strategy for better board detection
Test a categorical approach to data entry for models
